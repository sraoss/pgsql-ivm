 *
 *	In addition, we store the page's btree level (counting upwards from

 *	and status.  If the page is deleted, we replace the level with the
 *	next-transaction-ID value indicating when it is safe to reclaim the page.
 *
 *	We also store a "vacuum cycle ID".  When a page is split while VACUUM is
 *	processing the index, a nonzero value associated with the VACUUM run is
 *	stored into both halves of the split page.  (If VACUUM is not running,
 *	both pages receive zero cycleids.)	This allows VACUUM to detect whether
 *	a page was split since it started, with a small probability of false match
 *	if the page was last split some exact multiple of MAX_BT_CYCLE_ID VACUUMs
 *	ago.  Also, during a split, the BTP_SPLIT_END flag is cleared in the left
 *	(original) page, and set in the right page, but only if the next page
 *	to its right has a different cycleid.

 * Notes on B-Tree tuple format, and key and non-key attributes:
 *
 * INCLUDE B-Tree indexes have non-key attributes.  These are extra
 * attributes that may be returned by index-only scans, but do not influence
 * the order of items in the index (formally, non-key attributes are not
 * considered to be part of the key space).  Non-key attributes are only
 * present in leaf index tuples whose item pointers actually point to heap
 * tuples (non-pivot tuples).  _bt_check_natts() enforces the rules
 * described here.
 *
 * Non-pivot tuple format:
 *
 *  t_tid | t_info | key values | INCLUDE columns, if any
 *
 * t_tid points to the heap TID, which is a tiebreaker key column as of
 * BTREE_VERSION 4.  Currently, the INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK status bit is never
 * set for non-pivot tuples.
 *
 * All other types of index tuples ("pivot" tuples) only have key columns,
 * since pivot tuples only exist to represent how the key space is
 * separated.  In general, any B-Tree index that has more than one level
 * (i.e. any index that does not just consist of a metapage and a single
 * leaf root page) must have some number of pivot tuples, since pivot
 * tuples are used for traversing the tree.  Suffix truncation can omit
 * trailing key columns when a new pivot is formed, which makes minus
 * infinity their logical value.  Since BTREE_VERSION 4 indexes treat heap
 * TID as a trailing key column that ensures that all index tuples are
 * physically unique, it is necessary to represent heap TID as a trailing
 * key column in pivot tuples, though very often this can be truncated
 * away, just like any other key column. (Actually, the heap TID is
 * omitted rather than truncated, since its representation is different to
 * the non-pivot representation.)
 *
 * Pivot tuple format:
 *
 *  t_tid | t_info | key values | [heap TID]
 *
 * We store the number of columns present inside pivot tuples by abusing
 * their t_tid offset field, since pivot tuples never need to store a real
 * offset (downlinks only need to store a block number in t_tid).  The
 * offset field only stores the number of columns/attributes when the
 * INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK bit is set, which doesn't count the trailing heap
 * TID column sometimes stored in pivot tuples -- that's represented by
 * the presence of BT_PIVOT_HEAP_TID_ATTR.  The INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK bit in
 * t_info is always set on BTREE_VERSION 4 pivot tuples.
 *
 * In version 3 indexes, the INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK flag might not be set in
 * pivot tuples.  In that case, the number of key columns is implicitly
 * the same as the number of key columns in the index.  It is not usually
 * set on version 2 indexes, which predate the introduction of INCLUDE
 * indexes.  (Only explicitly truncated pivot tuples explicitly represent
 * the number of key columns on versions 2 and 3, whereas all pivot tuples
 * are formed using truncation on version 4.  A version 2 index will have
 * it set for an internal page negative infinity item iff internal page
 * split occurred after upgrade to Postgres 11+.)
 *
 * The 12 least significant offset bits from t_tid are used to represent
 * the number of columns in INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK tuples, leaving 4 status
 * bits (BT_RESERVED_OFFSET_MASK bits), 3 of which that are reserved for
 * future use.  BT_N_KEYS_OFFSET_MASK should be large enough to store any
 * number of columns/attributes <= INDEX_MAX_KEYS.
 *
 * Note well: The macros that deal with the number of attributes in tuples
 * assume that a tuple with INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK set must be a pivot tuple,
 * and that a tuple without INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK set must be a non-pivot
 * tuple (or must have the same number of attributes as the index has
 * generally in the case of !heapkeyspace indexes).  They will need to be
 * updated if non-pivot tuples ever get taught to use INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK
 * for something else.

 *
 * heapkeyspace indicates if we expect all keys in the index to be physically
 * unique because heap TID is used as a tiebreaker attribute, and if index may
 * have truncated key attributes in pivot tuples.  This is actually a property
 * of the index relation itself (not an indexscan).  heapkeyspace indexes are
 * indexes whose version is >= version 4.  It's convenient to keep this close
 * by, rather than accessing the metapage repeatedly.
 *
 * anynullkeys indicates if any of the keys had NULL value when scankey was
 * built from index tuple (note that already-truncated tuple key attributes
 * set NULL as a placeholder key value, which also affects value of
 * anynullkeys).  This is a convenience for unique index non-pivot tuple
 * insertion, which usually temporarily unsets scantid, but shouldn't iff
 * anynullkeys is true.  Value generally matches non-pivot tuple's HasNulls
 * bit, but may not when inserting into an INCLUDE index (tuple header value
 * is affected by the NULL-ness of both key and non-key attributes).
 *
 * When nextkey is false (the usual case), _bt_search and _bt_binsrch will
 * locate the first item >= scankey.  When nextkey is true, they will locate
 * the first item > scan key.
 *
 * pivotsearch is set to true by callers that want to re-find a leaf page

 *
 * scantid is the heap TID that is used as a final tiebreaker attribute.  It
 * is set to NULL when index scan doesn't need to find a position for a
 * specific physical tuple.  Must be set when inserting new tuples into
 * heapkeyspace indexes, since every tuple in the tree unambiguously belongs
 * in one exact position (it's never set with !heapkeyspace indexes, though).
 * Despite the representational difference, nbtree search code considers
 * scantid to be just another insertion scankey attribute.
 *
 * scankeys is an array of scan key entries for attributes that are compared
 * before scantid (user-visible attributes).  keysz is the size of the array.
