/*
 * On insert with split, we save all the items going into the right sibling
 * so that we can restore it completely from the log record.  This way takes
 * less xlog space than the normal approach, because if we did it standardly,
 * XLogInsert would almost always think the right page is new and store its
 * whole page image.  The left page, however, is handled in the normal
 * incremental-update fashion.
 *
 * Note: XLOG_BTREE_SPLIT_L and XLOG_BTREE_SPLIT_R share this data record.
 * There are two variants to indicate whether the inserted tuple went into the
 * left or right split page (and thus, whether the new item is stored or not).
 * We always log the left page high key because suffix truncation can generate
 * a new leaf high key using user-defined code.  This is also necessary on
 * internal pages, since the first right item that the left page's high key
 * was based on will have been truncated to zero attributes in the right page
 * (the original is unavailable from the right page).
 *
 * Backup Blk 0: original page / new left page
 *
 * The left page's data portion contains the new item, if it's the _L variant.
 * An IndexTuple representing the high key of the left page must follow with
 * either variant.
 *
 * Backup Blk 1: new right page
 *
 * The right page's data portion contains the right page's tuples in the form
 * used by _bt_restore_page.  This includes the new item, if it's the _R
 * variant.  The right page's tuples also include the right page's high key
 * with either variant (moved from the left/original page during the split),
 * unless the split happened to be of the rightmost page on its level, where
 * there is no high key for new right page.
